# Wannier.jl

A Julia package for playing with Wannier functions (WFs), including

- Generation of WFs from density functional theory (DFT) calculations
- Wannier interpolation of operators, e.g. band structure

Compared with [Wannier90](http://www.wannier.org/), the package provides different
Wannierization algorithm using matrix manifold optimization.
The expressive Julia language smoothens the developer experience and allows easier
experimentation of new ideas.

## Features

### Wannierization

### Interpolation

1. Wigner-Seitz interpolation
2. Minimal distance replica selection (MDRS) interpolation
